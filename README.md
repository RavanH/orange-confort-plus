Add the Orange Confort+ accessibility toolbar to your WordPress site.

### Features

* Layout: cancel layout, force left-aligned text, number list items, customize links appearance, display a reading mask.
* Colors: modify foreground and background colors.
* Behavior: direct access to main content on page load, automatic selection of page clickable elements with a user defined delay, page scrolling on simple user on hover.
