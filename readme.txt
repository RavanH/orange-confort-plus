Add the Orange Confort+ accessibility toolbar to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

[Orange Confort+](https://confort-plus.orange.com/index_en.html) aims to enhance user experience on websites. It works best when said websites are fully accessible.

= Features =

* Typography: font size, word-spacing, letter-spacing, line-height, font-face (Arial, Luciole, Open Sans, Open Dyslexic and Accessible DfA).
* Layout: cancel layout, force left-aligned text, number list items, customize links appearance, display a reading mask.
* Colors: modify foreground and background colors.
* Behavior: direct access to main content on page load, automatic selection of page clickable elements with a user defined delay, page scrolling on simple user on hover.

NB: Orange Confort+ does **not** fix website accessibility issues: blocking points still stay blocking points, with or without Orange Confort+.
